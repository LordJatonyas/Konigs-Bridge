# Konigs-Bridge
A 2D puzzle game inspired by Euler's "Seven Bridges of Konigsberg" thought experiment. (NOT QUITE DONE YET!)

To run the game, you'll need:
1) LÖVE2D Game Engine Application
2) "game" file from this repository 

There are 2 ways to run it:
1) Simply drag the "game" file into the LÖVE2D application
2) If you have a UNIX-based OS, from the game file's parent directory, run
```javascript
