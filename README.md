# Konigsberg
A 2D puzzle game inspired by Euler's "Seven Bridges of Königsberg" thought experiment.

## How To Play?
For a given playable level, your task is to cross every bridge just once. To prevent any confusion, I suggest going through the tutorial first before trying at the decks.

To run the game, download this [file](https://github.com/LordJatonyas/Konigsberg/blob/master/play/Konigsberg.zip) and double-click Konigsberg.html. You should be playing the game on your web browser in no time.

**Complete all the decks and receive your grade by solving SBOK.** Have fun!
