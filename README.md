# Königs Bridge
A 2D puzzle game inspired by Euler's "Seven Bridges of Königsberg" thought experiment. You'll have to cross every bridge just once in each level. The final level requires you to know a bit of history about the famous problem, and the challenge is to complete the game in 1 go. Have Fun!

To run the game, you'll have to download LÖVE2D on your computer. After that, there are 2 ways to run it:
1) Simply drag the "source" folder into the LÖVE2D application
2) If you run Linux/MacOS, go to the terminal and from the "source" folder's parent directory, run
```javascript
