# Konigsberg
A 2D puzzle game inspired by Euler's "Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg" thought experiment.

## Build Status
The game is incomplete. I will be adding several features to the game:

1) Addition of 3 "Decks" to the game, each "Deck" consisting of 8 levels
2) Addition of a proper tutorial
3) Making the final level a stand-alone option
4) Addition of new sounds

Once completed, I will provide instructions for running the game on your very own machine.
