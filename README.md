# Konigs-Bridge
A 2D puzzle game inspired by Euler's "Seven Bridges of Konigsberg" thought experiment. You'll have to cross every bridge just once in each level. Upon passing a given level, just press "Enter" to progress to the next. The final level requires you to know a bit of history about the famous problem, and the challenge is to complete the game in 1 go. To exit the game, press escape. Have Fun!
